            <img src="images/Dollar1.jpg" alt="Australian shepherd in a playpen looking up with a food bowl and towels on the side" width="400">
            <p>Dollar is a 1 and a half year old Australian shepherd. His favorite games are tug of war and fetch. Sometimes, when he goes out for walks, he will pick up a stick to get his owners to play fetch with him. At night, he likes to cuddle with his owners. He would snuggle up and put his nose on their arm to let them know that he wants pets. </p>
            <p>Dollar has a gourmet taste for food. He hates eating kibble and will only eat premium chicken bits with eggs. His favorite snacks are bell peppers, beef bits, and peanut butter. Dollar is incredibly smart and will only do tricks when you present him with snacks.             </p>

            <h2>Milo</h2>
                <img src="images/milo.jpg" alt="Milo, an 8 year old white Maltese family pet" width="400">
                        <p>Milo, a bashful yet warm-hearted dog, holds a deep appreciation for social interactions, whether they involve humans or fellow pets. Having spent his entire life with the same loving family, Milo's consistent displays of loyalty reflect his strong sense of familiarity and connection. He's known for his charming quirks, such as his penchant for taking a few steps backward instead of a simple turn when changing direction.</p>
                        <p>Despite his shyness, Milo's keen senses come to the forefront. At the sound of a passing car, his bark, though more bark than bite, resonates beyond the walls of the house. Interestingly, Milo has never quite grasped the concept of navigating stairs, yet he remains remarkably perceptive about his surroundings. It's this unique blend of traits that makes Milo an endearing presence, leaving a lasting impression on those fortunate enough to share in his companionship.</p>

                    <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400">
                            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isnâ€™t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. </p>
                            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>

                    <img src="images/leo_primary_photo.jpg" alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera" width="400">
                    <p>Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures.  Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.</p>
                    <p>Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.</p>

                    <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I`ve had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. Even though she`s old she`s still kickin` it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.</p>
                    <p>Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</p>
